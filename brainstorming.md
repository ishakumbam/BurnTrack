5. **PetCare Reminder** – Reminder app for pet feeding, grooming, medication, etc.

## Step 2: Top Two Ideas + Evaluation

### 1. BurnTrack

|----------|-------------|
| **Mobile** | Great fit for mobile – fitness tracking is highly mobile-centric. |
| **Story** | Clear value: allows users to instantly check calorie output after a workout. |
| **Market** | Strong market — fitness users, casual exercisers, dieters. |
| **Habit** | Moderate habit-forming potential: can be used daily after exercise. |
| **Scope** | Manageable – MVP could be 2-3 screens, using one external API. |

### 2. GreenThumb

| Attribute | Evaluation |
